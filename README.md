# ShopSystem
A system made in python3 designed to be used in stores.
It will have a Command-Line-Interface, and should be easy to use and setup.

# Pros
	+ All controlled via multiple CLIs (you can make your own interfaces)
	+ Simple to use program

# Cons
	+ Idk, I haven't really tested it yet
	+ Can only read barcodes from images
	+ Barcodes have unique 12-digit codes, so there are only so many you can have
